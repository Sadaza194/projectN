1. # AI Implementation Framework for projectN

    This document outlines the protocol for incorporating AI technology, specifically Chat-GPT 4, in the development of projectN.

    ## Utilization of AI Tools

    Our development process leverages Chat-GPT 4 for advancing ProjectN.

    ## Usage Policy and Best Practices

    Team members are encouraged to integrate Chat-GPT into their workflow under the following conditions:

    1. **Focused Application**: Utilize Chat-GPT for specific, well-defined tasks. This ensures seamless integration of AI-generated code into our project architecture, maintaining ease of maintenance.
    2. **Understanding and Accountability**: Developers should thoroughly understand any code segments adopted from Chat-GPT. They must be prepared to explain and justify their implementation choices.
    3. **Code Documentation**: If you implement code from Chat-GPT, write a comment about what it does and how it does it. This way, everyone else on the projectN team can quickly get what's going on.
