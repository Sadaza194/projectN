# Might Make Millions (MMM)

## Introduction:

To maintain a consistent development environment and streamline collaborative efforts, MMM has established a version control guideline for Project N. The platform of choice for this is GitHub, known for its robust version control capabilities and ease of collaboration.

## Git structure

ProjectN repository is going to have the following structure:

### Main branch:

Represents the production-ready, stable version of the software.

Version naming will be dictated by the significance of the update. This scheme establishes clear milestones for major updates while allowing for incremental improvements in between.

Example: ProjectN v1.0 → ProjectN v1.1 → Project N v2.0

Pushing to the main branch is a responsibility designated to one person, with this role rotating on a weekly basis to ensure diversity and shared understanding among team members.

### Dev branch

Acts as the central hub for all ongoing development, including core and experimental features.
Developers should fork from the Dev branch to work on specific tasks or features.

## Preventing Conflicts when Pushing

Conflicts can disrupt the development workflow and introduce bugs. To manage and minimize this, the following procedures must be observed:

1. Pre-Push Notification: Before initiating a push, announce your intent on the primary MMM communication channel (Discord).

2. Post-Push Notification: Once you've completed the push, promptly inform the team on the same channel.

Rules:

1. Respect the Push Notification: If a push notification appears in the channel, refrain from pushing to the repo until a "finished pushing" message is seen.

2. Timeliness: Ensure that after sending a push notification, the actual push and subsequent "finished pushing" message occurs within a 5-minute window. This prevents prolonged wait times and ensures an efficient workflow.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines, MMM aims to foster a harmonious, efficient, and productive development environment for Project N. All team members are urged to stay updated with these specifications and to ensure their adherence throughout the project's lifecycle.
