# Updates Document Phase 4

## AI Implementation Document

In this phase, the team introduced the use of Chat-GPT 4 as a support tool. Considering the ethical dilemmas of these kinds of tools, a guideline document on its use for projectN has been added to the documentation folder. 

## Design Document

Regarding the framework:

- Due to time concerns, we scaled down from using next.js to plain Java Script
- We are also using the extension "Sassy CSS". 

This two changes are reflected on the design document under Phisical "Design/Programming language(s) and any supporting tools to be used".
